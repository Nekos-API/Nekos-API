Nekos API is an open-source anime art API. It has CORS enabled and doesn't require authorization for it's main feaures.

## Features

Nekos API has lots of cool features:

- **Advanced**: Nekos API is probably the most advanced anime art API out there.
- **Thousands and thousands of art**: At the time of writing this, Nekos API has almost 40,000 images in it's database.
- **Continuous development**: Nekos API is constantly releasing new updates, so you'll never run out of features to try out (XD?)
- **Officially supported wrappers**: There are officially supported wrappers for Python, JS/TS, and Deno.
- **Documentation**: The API is almost 100% documented (non-documented features are still not stable)

## Development

Despite the fact that Nekos API is open source, it is not developed thinking on ease of set up. You can check the code to find all the env variables required, but you'll also need knowledge on Python with Django and PostgreSQL to be able to make it work correctly.

You'll also need a [Bunny](https://bunny.net) account and a storage + CDN to be able to host files.

I'll eventually dockerize the project, but ATM it's not and it's not the easiest project to set up locally.

## Projects using Nekos API

There are a few projects using Nekos API:

1. [Nekos.Land](https://nekos.land): A web client for Nekos API, developed by the Nekos API team.
2. [Nyatastic](https://go.nekogirl.net/invite-nyatastic): A multipurpose anime Discord bot.

*Psst! You can make a PR to add your project to this list :)*
