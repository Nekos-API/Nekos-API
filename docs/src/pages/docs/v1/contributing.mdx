# Contributing

We welcome all contributions to the project. There are many ways you can help us make the API better.

## Code contributions

If you have seen a bug and know how to fix it (and want to do it), there is nothing stopping you from doing so! Clone the [GitHub repo](github.com/Nekidev/nekos-api) and make a pull request when you're done 🙂.

## Suggestions

Any ideas on how to improve the API? We'd be glad to here from you! Join our Discord server and head to the `#suggestions` channel. We'll discuss it with the other team members.

## Other contributions

If you want to contribute in a way that we did not think of, it'd be great to hear from you! Send a message to any of the mods of our Discord server and we'll get to you as soon as possible.
