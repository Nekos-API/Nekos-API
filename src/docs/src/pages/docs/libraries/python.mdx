# Python 3

The [`anime-api`](https://pypi.org/project/anime-api) library is an officially supported Python 3 wrapper for Nekos API.

Source code: [GitHub](https://github.com/Nekidev/anime-api)

## Installation

The `anime-api` library can be installed on Python 3.7 and higher using pip, Poetry or Conda.

<Tabs items={["Pip", "Poetry", "Conda"]}>
    <Tab>
        ```bash
        pip install anime-api
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash
        poetry add anime-api
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash
        conda install anime-api
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Usage

The `anime-api` library contains lots of wrappers for different APIs, but we'll focus on the `NekosAPI(){:python}` class. You can import it from the `anime_api.apis` module.

```python showLineNumbers
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()
```

### Get a random image

The `NekosAPI(){:python}` class has a `get_random_image(){:python}` method that returns a random image.

```python showLineNumbers {6}
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

# This will return up to 10 images with the `kemonomimi` category
image = nekos.get_random_image(categories=["kemonomimi"])

print(image.url)
```

You can also get many images (up to 25) at once using the `get_random_images(){:python}` method instead.

```python showLineNumbers {7}
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

# The categories argument is optional. If not specified, the images will be
# completely random (no specific category)
images = nekos.get_random_images(limit=10, categories=["kemonomimi"])

for image in images:
    print(image.url)
```

### Get an image by it's ID

Every image in the API has its own ID. You can fetch an image by its ID to get a specific image's information.

```python showLineNumbers {6}
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

image_id = "some-uuid"
image = nekos.get_image_by_id(image_id=image_id)

assert image.id == image_id
print(image.url)
```

### Search for an artist

If you want to search for an artist, you can use the `get_artists(){:python}` method.

```python showLineNumbers {9}
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

# This will return up to 10 artists and skip the first 5. By default the limit
# is set to 10 and the offset is set to 0. The search argument is optional. If
# you don't specify it, a list of all artists available will be returned
# instead. Search is case-insensitive.
artists = nekos.get_artists(limit=10, offset=0, search="%?shiren%?")

for artist in artists:
    print(artist.name)
```

The search query format is explained [here](/docs/rest-api/reference#searching). You can also learn to escape queries [here](/docs/libraries/python#escape-a-search-query).

### Get an artist by it's ID

Each artist in the API has its ID. Although every image comes with (almost) all its artist information, fetching an artist by its ID has its advantages.

```python showLineNumbers {6}
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

artist_id = "some-uuid"
artist = nekos.get_artist_by_id(artist_id=artist_id)

assert artist.id == artist_id
print(artist.images)
```

As you can see, the `images` property is added to the `Artist` object when it's fetched by ID. This is not the case if the artist is fetched using a different method.

### Get all artist's images

If you want to fetch an artist's images, you can use the `get_images_by_artist_id(){:python}` method. This method returns up to 25 images and supports pagination.

```python showLineNumbers {7}
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

# This will return up to 10 images from arist with "some-uuid" as ID and skip
# the first 5. By default the limit is set to 10 and the offset is set to 0.
images = nekos.get_images_by_artist_id(artist_id="some-uuid", limit=10, offset=5)

for image in images:
    print(image.artist.name)
```

### Search for a category

To search for a category, you can use the `get_categories(){:python}` method.

```python showLineNumbers {9}
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

# This will return up to 10 categories and skip the first 5. By default the
# limit is set to 10 and the offset is set to 0. The search argument is optional. If
# you don't specify it, a list of all artists available will be returned
# instead. Search is case-insensitive.
categories = nekos.get_categories(limit=10, offset=0, search="%?catgi%?")

for category in categories:
    print(category)
```

The search query format is explained [here](/docs/rest-api/reference#searching). You can also learn to escape queries [here](/docs/libraries/python#escape-a-search-query).

### Get a category by it's ID

All categories have their unique ID, which is always returned together with the category. You can get a specific category using the `get_gategory_by_id(){:python}` method.

```python showLineNumbers {6}
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

category_id = "some-uuid"
category = nekos.get_category_by_id(category_id=category_id)

assert category.id == category_id
print(category.name)
```

### Search for a character

To search for a character, you can use the `get_characters(){:python}`.

```python showLineNumbers {9}
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

# This will return up to 10 characters and skip the first 5. By default the
# limit is set to 10 and the offset is set to 0. The search argument is optional. If
# you don't specify it, a list of all artists available will be returned
# instead. Search is case-insensitive.
characters = nekos.get_characters(limit=10, offset=0, search="%?kaguya%?")

for character in characters:
    print(character)
```

The search query format is explained [here](/docs/rest-api/reference#searching). You can also learn to escape queries [here](/docs/libraries/python#escape-a-search-query).

### Get a character by it's ID

Every character has it's unique ID, which is returned together with the character in every API response. You can get a specific charcater's information using the `get_character_by_id(){:python}` method.

```python showLineNumbers {6}
from anime_api.apis import NekosAPI

nekos = NekosAPI()

character_id = "some-uuid"
character = nekos.get_character_by_id(character_id=character_id)

assert character.id == character_id
print(character.name)
```

## Helpers

### Escape a search query

Sometimes you might want to make a query that contains special characters like `[` or `*`.

```python showLineNumbers filename="escape_query.py" {5}
from anime_api.apis.nekos_api import NekosAPI, EscapedQuery

nekos = NekosAPI()

escaped_query = EscapedQuery("`[` or `]` or maybe `*`?")

characters = nekos.get_characters(search=escaped_query)

for character in characters:
    print(character.name)
```

Using the `EscapedQuery(){:python}` class, you can easily escape special characters to use them as literals.

This is what actually happens undercover:

```python
>>> from anime_api.apis.nekos_api import EscapedQuery
>>>
>>> query = "`[` or `]` or maybe `*`?"
>>> escaped = EscapedQuery(query)
>>>
>>> str(escaped)
`\\[` or `\\]` or maybe `\\*`\\?
```

This way, you can search for special characters without any problems. If you wanted, you could also use `f-string`s to make even more complex queries. For example:

```python showLineNumbers filename="complex_escaped_query.py" {5}
from anime_api.apis.nekos_api import NekosAPI, EscapedQuery

nekos = NekosAPI()

query = f"({EscapedQuery('[ and ]')}) | ({EscapedQuery('{ and }')})"

characters = nekos.get_characters(search=query)

for character in characters:
    print(character.name)
```

This way, you'd be matching characters that contain either `[ and ]` or `{ and }`.
